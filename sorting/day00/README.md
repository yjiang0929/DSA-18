# Sorting Day00 - `InsertionSort` and `MergeSort`

## Learning Goals

By doing this assignment, you should be able to:

* Understand and justify the runtime and space complexities of each sort
* Understand how these two sorts are implemented.
* Improve true efficiency of Merge sort by using insertion sort on smaller arrays
  
## Resources

* We created a set of [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hJTO3d5spM1QZKrWfw5P5u_nkAtMmQEFYrKT-Dbah3M/edit?usp=sharing) to help you visualize merge sort.

## Assignment

### Sorts

- Draw the recursive trees (see [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hJTO3d5spM1QZKrWfw5P5u_nkAtMmQEFYrKT-Dbah3M/edit?usp=sharing)) of the merge sort algorithm for the input array `[4,8,62,9,14,19]`. Show (a photo of) this to your NINJA at checkoff.
- In `InsertionSort.java` and `MergeSort.java` complete the `sort` method.
- For each `sort` function, detail the best, worst, and average case runtime complexity, as well as the space complexity, in the comments.

### Data Structures Review (Boomerang)

**Time: O(N^2) / Space: O(N)**.  Given an array containing n tuples of points in a plane, a "boomerang" is a set of points (i, j, k) such that the distance between i and j is equal to the distance between j and k.  Find the number of boomerangs on the plane. Note that you can never have an odd number of boomerangs because every boomerang set counts twice, as it can be flipped.<br />
For example: Given the set of points [(0,0),(1,0),(2,0)], you should return 2.  The boomerangs are [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0)] and [(2,0), (1,0), (0,0)].<br />

Test your code with `BoomerangTest.java`.

<details> 
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
    If you have n points equidistant from point j, then there are n*(n-1) total boomerangs with j at the center.

<details> 
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>
    How can you use Hashmaps to your advantage for this problem?

### Getting checked off

- Talk your NINJA through your recursive trees for merge sort.
- Talk your NINJA through the four commented complexities for the sorting algorithms.
- Talk your NINJA through how you solved the boomerang problem, and why it satisfies the specified complexities.
