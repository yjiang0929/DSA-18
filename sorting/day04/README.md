## Assignment

For this assignment, **choose one of the following algorithms, and complete the associated file so the tests pass.**

### Boston Skyline

Suppose you are looking out at Boston's skyline, and you see a series of building in a 2D plane. You know the `left`-boundary, `right`-boundary, and `height` of each building. Each for example, the following buildings

![](https://i.imgur.com/em5O3uy.jpg)

Are represented by `[[1, 3, 2], [2, 4, 1], [3, 5, 4], [6, 8, 2], [7, 9, 1]]`.

Your task is to write an algorithm that outputs the "skyline" of a series of buildings, represented by the left-most point of each line along the silhouette. For example, the previous building's skyline looks like this:

![](https://i.imgur.com/gktU3lV.jpg)

For this series of buildings, your function would return `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 0], [6, 2], [8, 1], [9, 0]]`. Your algorithm should run in better than `O(N^2)` time, where N is the number of buildings.

<details>
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
  First, imagine you already have two "skylines", and you overlay them. Write a function that outputs the corresponding "merged" skyline.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>
  Your algorithm for this problem will look very similar to mergesort.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 3</summary>
  Split the list of buildings in half. Calculate the skyline for each half, and then merge the results together.

### Radio Towers

You are tasked with validating a set of radio tower coordinates. No two towers share an x-coordinate, and no two towers share a y-coordinate. Your job is to make sure no two radio towers are within 1 euclidean mile of eachother, or they will broadcast over eachother.

Design and write a divide-and-conquer algorithm that determines if the set of towers contains two towers within 1 mile of eachother. Return false if there are two such towers. Your input comes in the form of two sorted lists. `Lx` contains all the towers sorted in ascending order by `x` coordinate, and `Ly` contains the towers sorted in ascending order by `y` coordinate. Both lists contain the same set of towers, just in a different order.

For your "Combine" step, we recommend you write an algorithm that, given a "strip" `S` of radio towers whose y-coordinates fall in 2-mile vertical strip, sorted by x-coordinate, returns if `S` is valid in O(N) time. We have provided a function header for this function, as well as unit-tests.

After the "Divide" and "Conquer" steps, if the subproblems do not find any violation, the only place violations can still happen is in the strip `S`, which we check in the "Combine" phase using `checkStrip`.

When implementing `checkStrip`, use the following pseudocode:

```
checkStrip(strip) {
  for i in [0, strip.length):
    for j in [i + 1, i + 8):
      if j < strip.length and (strip[i] and strip[j] within distance 1 of eachother):
        return False
  return True
}
```

Note that for a tower `t` in `S`, we check the distance between `t` and 7 towers in `S` following `t` (which have larger x coordinates). If any pair has distance within 1, return false. The following is a proof of why this is sufficient for the "Combine" step:

We divide `S` into squares of size 1/2. No two valid towers can be in the same 1/2 by 1/2 square. Each square contains at most one tower, otherwise a pair within the same square should have been detected during "Conquer". For a tower `t` in `S`, a following tower within distance 1 must be inside a 2-by-1 rectangle along the strip. There are only 8 such squares. Thus, excluding `t` itself, only 7 following towers need to be checked. (Towers with smaller x coordinates have already been checked against `t`.)

<details>
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
  Split the problem in half with a horizontal line. Then divide and conquer.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>
  Solve the problem for the top-half and bottom-half of towers by recursively calling `validTowers` and splitting apart `Lx` and `Ly` into the `Lx` and `Ly` for the top and bottom halves of the towers. Then use your `checkStrip` function on the towers along the border of the two halves.

### Peak-Finding

#### 1-D Array

Imagine you had a 1-dimensional array of numbers. A peak of that array would be any element that is not less than either of its neighbors (assuming `nums[-1] = nums[N]= -INF`). For example, in `[3,2,3,4,5,6,4,3,2]`, the peaks are the first `3` and the `6`. In `[1,1,1,1,1]`, every element is a peak.

One way of solving this in `O(N)` time is to look at every element until you find an element that is a peak, or find the global maximum. We can do this in `O(log N)` time using a binary search technique! (how??)

**In `PeakFinding.java`, implement `int findOneDPeak(int[] nums)` and return the index of ANY peak in `O(log N)` time.**

#### 2-D Array

Now that you have warmed up, solve this same problem in two dimensions. An element is a peak in a two dimensional array if it is not less than any of its four non-diagonal neighbors (or at least the neighbors that exist, meaning values on the edges can also be peaks). Your algorithm is expected to run in O(N) time, where `N` is the length of one dimension of the grid, assuming it is a square.

##### O(NlogN) Solution

Think about using the 1-D method (which is `O(logN)`) on the max elements of each column, (finding each is `O(N)`), and comparing each max element to the elements on *directly* its left and right. You would only perform O(logN) max operations, so the overall runtime is O(NlogN).

The [MIT lecture notes](https://drive.google.com/open?id=189xjtCH--VZ7dug5-Df5Quig9GVuk35W) explain this algorithm thoroughly. If you prefer watching a lecture to reading notes, [here's the accompanying lecture](https://youtu.be/HtSuA80QTyo?t=15m26s).

##### Design an O(N) algorithm

**Implement `int[] findTwoDPeak(int[][] nums)`, where `answer[0]` is the row index and `answer[1]` is the column index of any peak. In other words, the peak is `nums[answer[0]][answer[1]]`.**

<details>
  <summary>Hint 1</summary>
  The problem with the NlogN solution is that even as we cut down the problem horizontally, the problem never shrinks vertically, and we keep paying an O(N) cost to find the max of the current column we're considering.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 2</summary>
  After we've "divided" the problem in half twice, how can we make sure the problem has been cut in half in both dimensions?
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Hint 3</summary>
  Alternate between looking at the max of a column and comparing it to the elements to its left and right and looking at the max of a row and comparing it to the elements above and below it.
