/**
 * The {@code EdgeWeightedGraph} class represents an edge-weighted
 * graph of vertices named 0 through <em>V</em> â€“ 1, where each
 * undirected edge is of type {@link Edge} and has a real-valued weight.
 * It supports the following two primary operations: add an edge to the graph,
 * iterate over all of the edges incident to a vertex. It also provides
 * methods for returning the number of vertices <em>V</em> and the number
 * of edges <em>E</em>. Parallel edges and self-loops are permitted.
 * By convention, a self-loop <em>v</em>-<em>v</em> appears in the
 * adjacency list of <em>v</em> twice and contributes two to the degree
 * of <em>v</em>.
 * <p>
 * This implementation uses an adjacency-lists representation, which
 * is a vertex-indexed array of  objects.
 * All operations take constant time (in the worst case) except
 * iterating over the edges incident to a given vertex, which takes
 * time proportional to the number of such edges.
 * <p>
 * For additional documentation,
 * see <a href="https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/43mst">Section 4.3</a> of
 * <i>Algorithms, 4th Edition</i> by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne.
