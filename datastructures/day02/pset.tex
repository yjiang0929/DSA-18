\noindent For each of the following problems, assume you are only given a \texttt{Node head} (or two), which is the head of a linked list. Focus on first getting a working solution, and then optimizing to a O(N) time O(1) space.

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{0}

\item Given two linked lists, check if they are equal.
    
\item Reverse a linked list. Return the new head node.

\item Check if a linked list is cyclic (that is, there is no node who's \texttt{next} pointer is \texttt{null}, because a node points to a previous node).

\item Check if a singly linked list is a palindrome. You can modify the linked list.
 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{}

Assumptions:

\begin{itemize}
  \item All stacks are listed from top to bottom.
  \item All problems can be solved using O(N) time and O(N) space unless noted otherwise.
  \item Stacks support: \texttt{push}, \texttt{pop}, \texttt{peek}, and \texttt{isEmpty}. They have no other methods.
\end{itemize}
    
\subsection*{}

\begin{enumerate}

\setcounter{enumi}{4}
    
\item Given an integer n, determine if it is palindromic (12,321 is palindromic, 23 is not) (Hint: Think about how you get the last digit of a number. i.e. 435 $\rightarrow$ 5).

\item Given a string of opening and closing parentheses, determine if it is a valid expression. That is, every opening paren has a closing partner eg \texttt{"()(())"} is valid, but \texttt{"()())(()"} is not.

\item How would you implement a queue using two stacks? You donâ€™t have to actually implement it, but either draw it or write an explanation on the board. Explain its operationsâ€™ runtimes (enqueue and dequeue). Use amortized analysis to discuss your runtimes. Find an instructor and discuss your solution.
\end{enumerate}
